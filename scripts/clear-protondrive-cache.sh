# Deletes the locally cached decrypted file contents for the Proton Drive
# mount, without touching anything in the cloud. The mount downloads and
# decrypts a file again on its next open (see contentStore.ts). Bound to a
# Nemo right-click action by install-nemo-clear-cache-action.sh.
#
# Caution: if a file under the mount is currently open in an app and dirty
# (unsaved changes), clearing the cache out from under it will make that
# file's upload-on-close fail, since the upload re-reads the local cache
# path from disk rather than the already-open handle. Only safe to run when
# nothing on the mount is actively being edited.
